This is the fork of iris that is in use on the StormBit IRC Network. (http://iris.stormbit.net/)

New content from both iris and qwebirc will be merged in with this repo, along with (usually untested) changes/alterations/improvements. For example, the implementation of SSL Server Connections is cleaner.
